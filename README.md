# Engineering Boat Redesign
All the openscad files for the 3D printed parts of the boat redesign

To make your own one-way valve, modify the parameters in the valve_composite file.

After you have the valve to your liking, simply copy and paste the different parameters
to all of the other files, which are conviently split up to make the 3D printing process
easier.
